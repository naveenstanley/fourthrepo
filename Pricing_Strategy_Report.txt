Pricing Strategy Report: Acute Emergency Communication Dashboard

Intro
This report summarizes the recommended pricing model and ROI framework for a payer-funded emergency communication dashboard that reduces acute care delays. It translates clinical impact into verified cost savings and ties price directly to measurable outcomes.

Context
- Product: Emergency communication dashboard for acute events (sepsis, stroke, major trauma)
- Buyer: Payer
- Pricing model: Percent of verified savings

Value Metric
Primary value driver: reduced adverse events / care delays
ROI anchored to the cost of delays avoided.

ROI Model
Let:
- N = annual cases
- R = baseline delay rate
- I = relative improvement
- C = cost per delay

Then:
- Delays avoided = N x R x I
- Annual savings = N x R x I x C

Inputs and Savings
- Sepsis: 18,000 cases, 22% delay, 30% improvement, EUR 9,500 cost
  Savings: EUR 11.286M
- Stroke: 12,500 cases, 18% delay, 25% improvement, EUR 14,000 cost
  Savings: EUR 7.875M
- Major trauma: 9,000 cases, 15% delay, 20% improvement, EUR 11,000 cost
  Savings: EUR 2.970M

Total Annual Savings
EUR 22.131M

Recommended Pricing
- Model: 10-15% of verified savings
- Price range:
  - 10% -> EUR 2.21M per year
  - 15% -> EUR 3.32M per year
- Add cap to reduce buyer risk (e.g., EUR 3.0M per year)
- Optional floor (e.g., EUR 500k per year) for commitment

Pilot Structure
- 90-day pilot
- Measure pre/post delay rate vs baseline
- Pricing options:
  - Fixed fee (e.g., EUR 75k), or
  - 5% of verified savings during pilot
- Rollout contingent on achieving target reduction

Why This Works
- Aligns price with payer outcomes
- De-risks adoption with measurable impact
- Scales with impact while preserving buyer confidence
